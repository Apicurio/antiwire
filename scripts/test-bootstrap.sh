# TASK-14.1: offline regression check for the verify.sh clone prerequisite.
#
# Proves, with a stubbed mvn (no real build) and a synthetic local upstream repository,
# that scripts/verify.sh obtains and validates the pinned upstream sources BEFORE the mvn
# build suite, and that every broken clone state fails fast with an explicit prerequisite
# message instead of reaching the build:
#
#   absent      no clone at the configured path: verify.sh clones it, validates the pin,
#               and mvn starts only with the clone already at the pin;
#   valid       a correct clone at the pin: reused (no re-clone), same ordering;
#   modified    a clone with local worktree modifications: rejected before mvn;
#   wrong       a clone of a different upstream whose tag resolves elsewhere: rejected
#               before mvn with the pin-mismatch error;
#   unreachable no clone and an unreachable repository URL: explicit prerequisite failure
#               before mvn.
#
# The stub mvn records its invocation and, at that moment, whether the clone is at the
# pinned commit with a clean worktree; that record is the ordering proof. Everything runs
# against local git repositories, so the check needs no network.
